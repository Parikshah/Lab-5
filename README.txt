Limitations/issues: There were some test that were failing from the given tests
Timing Comparisions:
    When the input size was 15 and the operation was remove: BSTree_Fast was executed in 22,160 nanoseconds 
    and BSTree_Slow was executed in 46,160 nanoseconds
    When the input size was increased to 25 and the operation remained the same, remove: BSTree_Fast was executed in 37,420 nanoseconds
    and BSTree_Slow was executed in 77,420 nanosecond

  Analysis: There is a positive linear relationship between the input size and the time.
